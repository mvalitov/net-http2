# We are currently locked to using the Http2 library v0.8.2 since v0.8.3 still has some compatibility issues:
# <https://github.com/igrigorik/http-2/issues/92>
#
# However, v0.8.2 had a memory leak that was reported in the following issues:
# <https://github.com/igrigorik/http-2/issues/73>
# <https://github.com/ostinelli/net-http2/issues/7>
#
# Hence, this is a temporary monkey-patch to the HTTP2 library in order to solve the mentioned leak
# while waiting to fix the issues on v0.8.3.
